# Financial_Dataset_Analysis
Project focuses on analyzing financial trends

📊 Finance Trends Project

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing financial trends using a dataset (Finance_Trends.csv). The workflow includes:-

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing in Jupyter Notebook with Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
Database Integration with MySQL using sqlite3, pymysql, and sqlalchemy.
Interactive Dashboard creation in Power BI for visualization and insights.


🛠️ Tools & Technologies :-

Python Libraries
pandas → Data cleaning, manipulation
numpy → Numerical operations
matplotlib & seaborn → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & visualization

Databases :-

MySQL → Data storage and querying:-
sqlite3, pymysql, sqlalchemy → Database connectivity and ORM

Visualization :-
Power BI → Dashboard creation and interactive reporting

📂 Dataset Description:-

File Name: Finance_Trends.csv
Content: Contains financial trend data across multiple attributes (e.g., dates, categories, values).

Cleaning Steps:

Standardized column names (removed special characters).
Converted non‑numeric columns to string type.
Handled missing values and ensured consistency.
Exploratory analysis with charts (line plots, bar charts, heatmaps).

⚙️ Workflow

Data Cleaning in Jupyter Notebook :-

Loaded CSV into Pandas DataFrame.
Cleaned column names and standardized data types.
Used numpy for numerical fixes and matplotlib/seaborn for visual checks.

Database Integration :-

Connected Jupyter Notebook to MySQL using pymysql and sqlalchemy.
Created dynamic tables with proper schema.
Inserted cleaned data into MySQL for persistence.

Power BI Dashboard :-

Imported MySQL data into Power BI.
Built interactive visuals (trend lines, KPIs, category breakdowns).
Enabled filtering and drill‑down for deeper insights.

📈 Insights :-

Identified financial trends across time periods.
Highlighted key growth/decline areas.
Built a dashboard for decision‑making and reporting.
